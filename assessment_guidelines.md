If you're unable to complete this section of the assessment project, please click here to continue .


> Once you've completed the above, create a new repository on `GitHub`, called `BitcubeEval`. (If you do not know how GitHub works, do some reading on the Internet, there are loads of resources available that will help you get started).

>
> Commit your work to the `master branch` on your GitHub repository with a `commit message 'Section 1'`. (Remember to push your work to GitHub, and not just commit to your local repository).

> After that, invite me to your project on GitHub. You do this by going to the BitcubeEval repository, then select the 'Settings' tab, and then click the 'Manage Access' menu item on the left. Then click the 'Invite collaborators' button and add my account name, nielbitcube, and click the 'Add' button.

> Once everything above is completed, click the Completed button below.

> Read this before you click the continue button:  `
Did you code this section and commit it to GitHub?
Did you invite me to your GitHub project?`

If you click the continue button and you did NOT do the above you will not be considered for the internship program. You will not be able to get back to this section of the assessment project either.
